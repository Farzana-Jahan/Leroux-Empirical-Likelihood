# Leroux-Empirical-Likelihood
This repository contains all the codes, functions, simulation codes and data sets we use for the BEL spatial leroux model.

simulation_BEL_leroux.R : This file generates some data to run the BEL leroux MCMC codes.We are generating data for each of 2147 SA2s in Australia arbitrarily. 
new_BEL_leroux_nobliock_Functions. R: this file contains the main functions of BEL leroux MCMC. 
tuning BEL leroux.R : This file contains codes to run the MCMC to tune the chains for reasonable acceptance
SA2_2011_AUST_qv7.gal : spatial file to create neighbourhood matrix R for running the simulation.
